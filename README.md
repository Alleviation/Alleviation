# Alleviation
Welcome to The Alleviation Project!

The dream is to create the ultimate programmaing experience: an immersive, interactive, helpful enviroment that tunes your
brain optimally. It will use a modular notation system, so that the computer directly ingests mathematical notation, instead
of code.

Note: no explicit license has been chosen at this time. I want credit given to contributors, but be open source. Details are under contemplation.
